# Work History Project Narratives

## EquipmentShare (Senior Data Scientist, September 2023 - Present)

**CCC Clustering Pipeline**: Built a generative pipeline that automatically extracts, summarizes, and clusters complaint, cause, and correction (CCC) data from unstructured technician work order notes. This system addressed the critical problem of incomplete structured data entry by service technicians, using advanced generative models to parse free-text descriptions and convert them into actionable insights. The automated pipeline continuously embeds and clusters the extracted CCCs to identify emerging service trends and equipment failure patterns, reducing the rate of unparsed notes by 82% and establishing the foundation for predictive maintenance ML models.

**Scoop (AI Agent)**: Developed an agentic system that connects with various fleet data resources to provide comprehensive performance summaries to executives. The AI agent, built using LangChain and FastAPI for the backend with React for the frontend, integrates work orders, service manuals, DTC code history, telemetrics data, and other critical data assets. This system represents a key component of moving the company's baseline ML and AI capabilities from 0 to 1, providing executives with intelligent, data-driven insights into fleet performance and maintenance optimization.

**ML Infrastructure Improvements**: Led the foundational buildout of ML infrastructure capabilities, moving the organization from no ML capabilities to a comprehensive data science platform. Developed the ds_tools library that became widely adopted by internal data scientists for seamless data resource access. Partnered with data engineering teams on the company's first Airflow deployment, creating DAG templates and tooling, while also collaborating on API application deployment processes and documentation. This infrastructure work enabled the team to transition from ad-hoc analysis to production-ready ML systems and established the engineering integration necessary for scalable AI initiatives.

## Abnormal Security (Senior Machine Learning Engineer, April 2022 - April 2023)

**Improving Internal Attack Detection**: Served as product owner for the internal email attack detection product, managing roadmapping, architecture decisions, and ML strategy. Analyzed patterns of missed attacks with emphasis on high-volume incidents to improve key security metrics. Investigation revealed a significant attack pattern involving document-sharing attempts from rarely-seen senders that existing systems were missing. Implemented regex matching features to capture this specific phrasing pattern and deployed simple decision rules after thorough backtesting and forward testing. The solution achieved remarkable success, reducing the false negative rate (missed-attack rate) by over 60% compared to baseline performance.

**Efficiency Improvements to Internal Message Processing**: Led a critical organization-wide initiative to reduce message processing costs while maintaining security effectiveness. The core insight involved leveraging account-level behavioral information to gate which messages required full processing, since attack detection was recorded at both account and message levels. Conducted extensive historical analysis to determine optimal thresholds for account "suspiciousness" and refined behavioral pattern definitions. Monitored model performance during incremental rollout and helped shepherd the efficiency improvements through to production, ultimately achieving a 13% reduction in overall AWS processing costs.

## Stitch Fix (Senior Data Scientist, May 2019 - March 2022)

**Improving the Connection Between Merch & Forecasting**: Led cross-functional collaboration with the merchandising team to address the critical disconnect between the canonical business forecast engine and core purchasing decisions. The forecast engine backed multiple inventory optimization systems but wasn't being effectively leveraged for strategic merchandising choices. Designed an integration solution with existing merchandising tooling and secured buy-in from key stakeholders across algorithms and merchandising teams. Despite strong user alignment and stakeholder support, the project never reached production due to organizational turbulence and instability that prevented implementation of the proposed structural process changes.

**Deep Dive on Forecast Accuracy**: Developed a comprehensive backtesting framework to analyze bias and variance in the canonical business forecast engine, with the goal of achieving unbiased predictions across all inventory optimization systems. Implemented simulation models to account for missing business aspects in existing forecasts and aligned variable definitions to improve adoption among downstream users. Applied systematic low-hanging-fruit improvements to the forecasting methodology, resulting in a 60% decrease in mean absolute error and significantly enhancing the reliability of inventory optimization decisions.

**Forecast Dashboard & Alerting**: Built comprehensive forecast monitoring tools to ensure the canonical forecast engine remained within reasonable bounds across all nodes in the business hierarchy. Developed interactive notebooks using JavaScript via Observable for visualization and implemented Python-based continuous alerting systems for anomaly detection. These monitoring and alerting systems increased trust in the forecasting platform and improved adoption rates among downstream users by providing transparency, proactive issue identification, and confidence in forecast fidelity.
